# Master Thesis

The code is messy, but considering nobody will probably try to replicate this study, that doesn't matter too much. Contact me if you're interested and need help setting things up.

# Installation and dependencies

- See `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` for the list of dependencies and their versions
- Note that [OCTIS](https://github.com/MIND-Lab/OCTIS) currently requires manual installation because of a dependency on old scikit-learn. This has already been reported in the upstream OCTIS repository, but hasn't been fixed yet.
- A slightly modified version of [SwissLog](https://github.com/IntelligentDDS/SwissLog) is contained in the `Adapted-SwissLog` folder.
